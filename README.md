# Hybrid-LLM-ACT-R
We observed significant behavior disparities between Chat GPT 3.5 and humans while prompting Chat GPT with problem-solving questions. The problem involved using three sticks (e.g.:14 cm, 200 cm, and 37 cm) to create a target length (e.g.: 112 cm), the Building Sticks Task {Schunn, 2001 #3195}. Only one of the two strategies were allowed: 
Undershoot: Beginning with a stick shorter than the target length and adding lengths incrementally. 
Overshoot: Starting with a stick longer than the target length and "sawing off" lengths until reaching the desired size. 
The optimal theoretical solution given the task and sticks available is the overshoot strategy {Schunn, 2001 #3195}.
